The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and avoiding unnecessary use of `!important`.  Here's a corrected version of the CSS:

```css
.container {
  color: blue;
}

.container p {
  color: red; /* Remove !important */
}

p {
  color: green;
}
```

By removing the `!important` flag, the specificity rules correctly apply. The more specific `.container p` rule overrides both the `.container` and the `p` rules, resulting in the expected red color for paragraphs within the container.  This approach promotes maintainability and predictability in your CSS.
